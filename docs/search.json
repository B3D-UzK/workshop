You can do this by using DB app (DB Navigator) to check the train schedule. Once you have determined that there is a train that goes from Köln Hbf to Köln Süd, you will need to purchase a ticket for the train. You can do this at the train station or online via DB app.\nWhen you arrived Köln Süd you need to walk to the workshop, you will first need to determine if the distance of about 700 meters is feasible to walk. If you feel comfortable walking this distance, you can simply follow the most direct route which is showed on below. You can use a map or a navigation app to help you find the best way to walk.\n\n\n\nMap showed how to walk from Köln Süd Station to the B3D Workshop\n\n\n\n\nTravel by Tram 18 (Straßenbahn 18)\nTo travel from Cologne main station (Köln Hbf) to Köln Eifelwall/ Stadtarchiv station by tram, you will need to first locate the tram stops near Cologne main station (Dom/Köln Hbf in underground or Breslauer Platz Station). Once you have found the nearest tram stop, look for a tram heading in the direction of Köln Eifelwall/ Stadtarchiv station (5-6 stops heading to Köln Klettenbergpark). You will need to purchase a ticket for the train. You can do this at the train station or online via DB Navigator (DB app).\nOnce you have arrived at Köln Eifelwall/ Stadtarchiv station, you can walk to the workshop by following the map provided. The workshop is approximately 600 meters, from the station, so the walk should take about 10 minutes depending on your pace. You can use a map or a navigation app to help you find the best way to walk.\n\n\n\nMap showed how to walk from Köln Eifelwall/ Stadtarchiv Station to the B3D Workshop"

This cycle is important for understanding the chemical evolution of the universe and the influence of star formation on the evolution of galaxies. The study of the cosmic matter cycle involves combining observations and modeling to understand the physical and chemical processes that occur during star formation in the interstellar medium, including the formation of molecular clouds, the distribution of stellar masses, the transport of heavy elements into intergalactic space, and the impact of feedback effects from young stars on their environment. Key questions in this field for the coming decade include understanding the role of magnetic fields and radiation in the formation of stars, the role of molecular clouds in the formation of planetary systems, the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time, and the impact of the cosmic matter cycle on the evolution of the universe as a whole."

The study of galaxy evolution involves using observatories to observe starlight and gas and dust radiation, and using 3D spectroscopy to analyze the properties of galaxies. The central questions in this field for the coming decade include understanding the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time, the formation and activity of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei, the nature of dark matter, and the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.

    "section": "Cosmology and the young universe",
    "text": "Cosmology and the young universe\nThe early universe was very evenly distributed, but today it is structured into galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the cosmic web. Astronomers have developed the Standard Model of cosmology, also known as the model of cold dark matter, to explain how these structures formed. The model relies on the existence of dark matter and dark energy, which make up about 25% and 70% of the mass-energy content of the universe, respectively. However, these components have not yet been directly detected and their properties are not fully understood. The model has been successful in describing the evolution of structures in the universe, but there are still many questions to be answered about the formation of the cosmic web, the early phases of the universe, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the origin of matter. In the coming decade, researchers hope to make progress on these questions through various methods including the detection of dark matter particles and the detection of ionizing radiation from the first structures in the universe."

    "text": "Extreme states of the cosmos, fundamental astrophysics\nThe cosmic matter cycle is the process of star formation, stellar evolution, and the return of enriched material to the interstellar medium. This cycle is essential for understanding the chemical evolution of the universe and the influence on the formation of planetary systems and the potential for the origin of life. The study of star formation from the interstellar medium is a central topic in modern astrophysics and requires the combination of technical observations and different areas of physics. Galaxies are the building blocks of the universe and contain cool interstellar gas from which new stars form. Processes in stars and galaxies determine the cosmic matter cycle. The Milky Way is a typical spiral galaxy and many galaxies contain a massive black hole at their center. Dark matter and dark energy, which have not yet been directly detected, are believed to play a role in the dynamics of galaxies and the expansion of the cosmos. Cosmology is the study of the evolution of the universe and the formation of structures such as galaxies and the cosmic web. Fundamental astrophysics involves the study of extreme states in the universe, including the evolution of black holes, the equation of state of nuclear matter, gravitational waves and gravitational physics, and cosmic rays. These studies can provide insight into fundamental physical laws and test them."
